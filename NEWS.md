Interactions!

## Summary of larger updates:

# conjointTools 0.0.1

- Created new functions for creating different experiment designs:
    - Full factorial
    - "D", "A", and "I" optimal designs
- Modified previous functions for creating a coded survey from a given experiment design
- Changed the output of the sampleSizer function to show the sample size (rather than the number of observations, which can be different since respondents may answer more than one choice question).

# conjointTools 0.0.0.9000

- Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
